EXERCISE 02	- PATHS, FOLDERS, DIRECTORIES (pwd)

>pwd

Write down pwd 20 times, spelling "Print Working Directory" in your head.

EXERCISE 03	- GET BACK HOME

>pwd	(telss you where you are)
>cd ~	(takes you home)

EXERCISE 04	- MAKE DIRECTORY (mkdir)

>mkdir temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john

Create 20 directories inside the tem folder

Create a folder with a space by the command: mkdir temp/"I Have Fun"

EXERCISE 05	- CHANGE DIRECTORY (cd)

>pwd
>cd ~
>cd temp
>cd stuff
>cd ..
>cd ../..
>cd temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john
>cd ../../../../../../../

EXERCISE 06	- LIST DIRECTORY (ls)

>pwd
>cd ~
>cd temp
>ls
>ls

EXERCISE 07	- REMOVE DIRECTORY (rmdir)

*This command line remove an EMPTY directory
>pwd
>cd ~
>cd temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex/john/
>cd ..
>ls
>rmdir john

Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time.

EXERCISE 08	- MOVE AROUND (pushd, popd)

>pwd
>cd ~

>mkdir -p i/like/icecream
[make an entire path even if all the directories don't exist]

>pushd 
[save the current location and go to a new location]
[you always have to include the directory you want to go]

>popd
[return to the saved location]

move around directories all over your computer

EXERCISE 9	- MAKE EMPTY FILES (New-Item)

>pwd
>cd ~

>New-Item *.txt -type file 

EXERCISE 10	- COPY FILE (cp)

>cd ~
>pwd

>cd temp
>cp iamcool.txt neat.txt
>ls

>cp neat.txt awesome.txt

>cp awesome.txt thefourthfile.txt

>mkdir something

>cp awesome.txt something/

>ls something

>cp -recurse something newplace
>ls newplace

Use cp -r command to copy more directories with files

Copy a file to your home directory or desktop

EXERCISE 11	- MOVE A FILE (mv)

>mv awesome.txt uncoll.txt
>mv newplace oldpace

Moving files inside the same folder means renaming them => give the old name a new name

EXERCISE 12	- VIEW A FILE (less, MORE)

Exercise 12: View a File (less, MORE)

To do this exerciser, you're going to do some work using the commands you know so far. You'll also need a text editor that can make plain text (.txt) files. Here's what you do:
- Open your text editor and type some stuff into a new file.
- Save that file to your desktop and name it test.txt.
- In your shell, use the commands you know to copy this file to your temp directory that you've been working with.
Once you've done that, complete this exercise.

>more test.txt

EXERCISE 13	- STREAM A FILE (cat)

>more test2.txt

>cat test2.txt

cat displays all the .txt fyle content without making it possible to see through pages. It shows everything by one time.

Try cat test.txt,test2.txt
That displays both at same time, one after another.

EXERCISE 14	- REMOVE A FILE (rm)

>pwd
>cd ~

>cd temp
>ls

>rm uncool.txt
>ls

>rm iamcool.txt
>rm neat.txt
>rm thefourthfile.txt
>ls

>rm something/awesome.txt
>rmdir something
>rm -r newplace
>ls

DANGER!!Be careful when running recursive remove on files!!DANGER!!

EXERCISE 15	- EXIT YOUR TERMINAL (exit)

>exit

DO MORE!

HELP

>Get-Help Get-ChildItem

Is the same as

>Get-Help ls

Which is the same as

>ls -?

or

>help ls

Which shows the help page, one page at a time

STATISTICAL OPERATIONS

Create a *.txt file with this information
Name, Score
Robo 1, 34
Robo 2, 36
Robo 3, 04
Robo 4, 02

Save it on temp directory

>Import-Csv MeasureObject.txt | Measure-Object score -ave -max -min
